## Purpuse
Our Pomodoro website is designed to help individuals enhance their productivity and time management skills through the popular Pomodoro Technique. By utilizing a simple and effective time management method, we aim to assist users in breaking down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Our platform provides a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to easily set timers, track their work sessions, and manage their breaks effectively.
